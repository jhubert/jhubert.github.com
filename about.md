## _"It's kind of fun to do the impossible."_

The above quote, originally by Walt Disney, has resonated with me ever since I was a kid. It takes something hopeless and makes it's much more approachable.. literally making the impossible seem not only possible, but worth attempting. Yes, it will be hard, but you'll be happy to did it in the end.

To me, that is the ultimate goal of problem solving. Working your way around a situation until you not only succeed, but you reach a solution that is satisfying. Puzzles of all sorts have always engaged me; whether they be in life, love, code or materials. My passion for the things that I undertake in life can almost always be defined by the underlying puzzle.

Programming appeals to me not because I really like math or typing, but because of it's ability to explore and solve problems. With code, I can construct everything from simple math equations to systems that open communication around the world and introduce people to entirely new ways of thinking. The capability of the tips of my fingers is exponentially multiplied by the other amazing people collaborating and sharing ideas around the world.

Working together, we can tackle nearly anything. I am humbled and excited to be part of that.
