<div id="posts">
  <h2>A brief history of mine</h2>
  <p>Some of these go back to my blog in the early days of my internet life. I read these every now and then to see how I have grown over time. I lay them bare here for your discovery. Please treat them with care.</p>
  <ul>
    {% for post in site.categories.article %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> - <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
