<p><span>Well, I&#8217;ve been here almost 2 weeks now. I LOVE IT HERE! I&#8217;m seriously thinking I should accept the offer to stay here for a YEAR!! :D</span></p>

<p><span>Umm.. on that note. I haven&#8217;t really gone out much. I&#8217;ve been working from 9am to midnight almost every day of the week since I got here. I have some pretty serious deadlines to hit, so it&#8217;s intense. I should be able to relax in the beginning of May though. :) I&#8217;ve only gone out a few times since I arrived. The first was to the Glennferrie Hotel, or something. It was like a cross between the blarney stone and the Roxy. Weird combination I know, but seriously. Next was a strip club called the Mens Gallery. It wasn&#8217;t all that great, but it was different than strip clubs in Van. Girls were walking around naked everywhere chatting to guys and then some were dancing on tables. It wasn&#8217;t as structured as the ones in Canada.</span></p>

<p><span>I also checked out Crown, an entertainment complex in Melbourne. It has a Casino, Nightclubs, Restaurants, Stores, etc. It&#8217;s like a massive shopping mall, but better. We hit up heat nightclub for their $2 highball night. It was an R&amp;B night and it reminded me of a smaller Atlantis. Not bad.</span></p>

<p><span>Last night, I went to a club called Element. No, sorry.. called Saratoga.. but I SWEAR it&#8217;s Element. Same kind of music, same kind of people, same feel, same look and the same stairwell entrance. Nice place&#8230; got really drunk. Oops. I&#8217;m hungover today.</span></p>

<p><span>Oh, did I mention that Melbourne reminds me a lot of Vancouver? I don&#8217;t really feel like I&#8217;ve gone anywhere. Just the people have accents and it&#8217;s a bit warmer.</span></p>

<p><span>As for my life, I&#8217;ve been put up in a cute apartment in downtown Melbourne. Pretty basic, but it has most things I need, and the location is pretty sweet. I&#8217;m catching the tram to work every morning, which is like a slow bus that is strapped to a rail. Oh! The cell phone networks here are nuts. I love it! Everyone SMS&#8217; each other. No one in Van uses SMS, but it&#8217;s totally sweet. I have a little Nokia phone to play with. :D Cell phones are stupid expensive down here though.</span></p>

<p><span>The girls are pretty hot. There are a lot of THIN girls who are totally sexy, which is nice. I haven&#8217;t really talked to many girls though because I&#8217;ve been working so much, and when I have met them I was too drunk to remember it. :|</span></p>

<p><span>I bought a video camera, so I&#8217;ll be putting up short movies of my adventure if I ever find the time to piece them together. :P</span></p>

<p><span>Oh! The concert I&#8217;m throwing on the 26th is coming together nicely. It&#8217;s really weird to not be there and have control over it, but i&#8217;m crossing my fingers that the people I&#8217;ve put in place are doing it right. You can get more information on it here:</span></p>

<p><span>Umm.. Losing weight: Good. Losing Sleep: Normal. Losing Sanity: Bad.</span></p>

<p><span>I&#8217;m in love&#8230; but that&#8217;s a different story all together.</span></p>

<p><span>Oh. Everything is deep fried here. And they have funny words for things. I&#8217;m learning.</span></p>

<p><span>Bye for now,</span></p>

<p><span>Jer</span></p>
