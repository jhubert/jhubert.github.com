## Quitting is for winners

Yesterday I took the plunge and spoke to my employer about ending my career with them. As I tell my family and friends, the most common response I get is "Wow.. Why?" My problem with that question is that I can't really answer it in a way that they understand.

For a while now, I have been feeling as if I have reached a plateau with my current job. I have now slipped into a comfort zone where I know I'm getting a paycheck, and I don't need to work all that hard to get my job done. Since my salary is already a fair bit higher than most of the people I know my age, a lot of them tend to wonder why I would give all that up with no other job to move on to.

My response is that I do not WANT to get comfortable. I am 23. I have a LOT to learn, and now is NOT the time to sit back and relax. While you're young, it is imperative to take in the world and learn as much as you can, not only about the world, but also about who you are as a person.

While all this is going on in my head, I happened to upon [James Archer's Website][1] where he had a rather insightful entry about Entrepreneurialism. He quotes from Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay "[Self-Reliance][2]" and in doing so, speak very truthfully about how I am currently feeling in life.

I recommend you pop over and give the essay a read. It may shed some light on your life, but if not, at least it will definitely help you understand my life.

With that in mind, I introduce to you [Illanti][3], which is my development company. It is time to kick start my education, and launch myself back into the Free(lance)-world. For better or for worse, self-reliace is more important to me right now than comfort and complacency.
