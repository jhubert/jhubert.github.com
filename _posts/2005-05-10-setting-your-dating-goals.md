## Setting your dating goals

Many guys start out with really ambitious goals. They don't think small and they go straight to the top. What do they want? They want a girlfriend, or they want sex, or they want to engage the girl in a lenghtly session of mutual masturbation with an entire cheerleading squad... ok, maybe that one is just me. Either way, the problem here is that that's their <span class="caps">ONLY</span> goal. Everything else is a failure. If they actually get up the balls to talk to a girl, and she talks back, but she doesn't drop to her knees right then and there... they think they have been unsuccessful. This of course is further encouraged by the many internet porn sites that show seemingly ugly men picking up semi-attractive women and then jumping to a scene of strange sex in some poorly planned out location.

> Note to reader: Most girls aren't like that. Well, at least not the girls you would be interested in getting to know better. Of course, if that's what you're looking for, grab a few hundred bucks and walk around the shady area of your city... you're bound to catch something.

So, back to the first part of the question. What's your wishlist. Break it down to smaller bits. Here is an example:

Today, I would like to see a girl and:

* Make her smile
* Make her laugh
* Have her say hello to me
* Find out her name
* Have a five minute conversation
* Get her phone number
* Get a date with her
* Kiss her
* Makeout in a park
