title: Flight searching done right
---

<p>Finding a good place to go on vacation has always been hard for me. Like most people, I&#8217;m cheap when it comes to big purchases, and since I spent so much time in Maui when I was a kid, I don&#8217;t really subscribe to the idea of spending a few thousand dollars per person to relax on a beach.</p>



<p>I also don&#8217;t really have any restrictions on when I take a vacation, so all I&#8217;m really looking for is a good deal that I can snap up for a few days away&#8230; or a good price on a flight to somewhere that I can dissapear for a few weeks.</p>



<p>For those reasons, finding flights has always been hard.  I don&#8217;t care about the flight dates.  I don&#8217;t care about the destination.  In fact, I don&#8217;t care which Airport I leave from - SEA (Seattle )is only an hour.5 away from YVR (Vancouver).  All I want to do is say where I am, and have them tell me what my options are&#8230; and I want them to do it quickly and comprehensively.  To be picky, I would also like them to tell me in Canadian Dollars so that I don&#8217;t have to convert it in my head.</p>



<p>Well wouldn&#8217;t you know it.  The geniuses over at <a href="http://www.kayak.com">Kayak</a> have gone and built <a href="http://www.kayak.com/h/buzz/flights">the best flight search I have ever seen</a>.  It does pretty much everything I would want it to do.  It&#8217;s quick, it&#8217;s easy, and I can tell it my currency..</p>



<p>It sites like this that make me love the internet.</p>



<p>Thank you Kayak. :)</p>
