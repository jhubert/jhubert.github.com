<p>I did something really stupid today.  I deleted all of the .svn folders in my project before committing my changes, and after building a major addition to it.  I was trying to delete them from another folder, and used the wrong terminal window. :|</p>

<p>Anyway, point being, I fixed it!</p>

<p>Here is what I did:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
> pwd
~/Development/project_name/
> cd ..
> svn co http://svn.domain.com/repo/trunk/ project_name_temp/
> cd project_name_temp
> find .  -type d -name ".svn" -exec mv -f '{}' ../project_name/log/.'{}'  \;
find: ./app/.svn: No such file or directory
find: ./app/apis/.svn: No such file or directory
(repeated.. this is normal)
> cd ..
> rm -R project_name_temp/
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The key was:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
find .  -type d -name ".svn" -exec mv -f '{}' ../project_name/log/.'{}'  \;
{% endhighlight %}
