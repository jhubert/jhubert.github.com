<blockquote>It does not seem to be true that work necessarily needs to be unpleasant. It may always have to be hard, or at least harder than doing nothing at all. But there is ample evidence that work can be enjoyable, and that indeed, it is often the most enjoyable part of life.</blockquote>&#8212;Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, 1990
