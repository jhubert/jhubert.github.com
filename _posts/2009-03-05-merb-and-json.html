title: wrong argument type Hash (expected Data) - Merb json
---

<p>I was having a heck of a time with .to_json in Merb. Turns out, it was because Merb&#8217;s to_json implementation doesn&#8217;t work the same as ActiveRecords.</p>

<p>In order to get it working, I had to disable the Merb one by placing the following code at the top of my init.rb file:</p>

<p>Merb.disable :json</p>

<p>Just thought I&#8217;d share. :)</p>
