title: Setting up a remote server to access my git repository

<p>I host all of my Git repositories on a box that has a different port than normal SSH connections use, which causes git checkouts to be a bit of a pain in the butt.</p>

<p>So, in order to deal with this, any computer I plan on continually using for Git access, I add to the git user&#8217;s authorized_keys list. Here is the step by step I use to make it easy.</p>

<p>All of these commands are performed on the computer I want to grant permission to.</p>

<p>First, make sure I have a public ssh key.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now, lets copy that public key to the Git server.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
scp -P 8888 .ssh/id_rsa.pub git@YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS:~
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Using a remote SSH command, lets append our id_rsa.pub file to the authorized keys list, and then delete the file since we won&#8217;t be using it anymore.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
ssh -p 8888 git@YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS "cat id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys; rm id_rsa.pub"
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Test the connection to make sure we can connect without a password. Just ssh and then exit immediately if it worked.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
ssh git@YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS -p 8888
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Alright, so once that works, you have permission&#8230; but it still doesn&#8217;t deal with the port problem. To do that, we will create a .ssh host in the config file.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
vi .ssh/config
{% endhighlight %}

<p>You want to add something that looks like this:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
host myserver
hostname YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS
user git
port 8888
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Once you&#8217;ve done that, save the file and exit.</p>

<p>Now, you should be able to clone your git repo without any problems. No more passwords, no more long git urls. Just beautiful simplicity.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
git clone myserver:commentize.git
{% endhighlight %}
