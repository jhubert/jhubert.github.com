<p><span><span class="journal_text">On Sunday we decided we needed a break from reality, so a bunch of the boys and I headed down to tsawwassen for a few hours of Paintball.<br/><br/><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20020604020855/http://www.jeremyhubert.com/images/photos/paintball.jpg"/> <br/><br/>We suited up and headed out into the combat zone; each of us armed with a semi-automatic paintball gun and a few hundred &#8220;bullets,&#8221; which was supposed to give us a chance in hell against the rest of the people who&#8217;d been playing for YEARS. Riiiiight. :/ <br/><br/>We got split up into 4 teams and headed off to battle. If you&#8217;ve never played paintball before, I highly recommend you try it. It&#8217;s such a rush to run through bushes trying to dodge the barrage of bullets that are headed directly for you. Even if you&#8217;re not the sporty type, you can get a kick out of paintball. Just perk yourself up on a hill and play &#8220;sniper&#8221; with the sitting ducks below. It&#8217;s GREAT. <br/><br/>Anyway, 8 members of my team were positioned in the swamp area and we were about to attack another team. We had a flank on the left, one on the right and a runner in the middle. I was sniper from behind, but someone 3 of my other team-mates ended up right next to me. All of a sudden, out of the blue, I get shot in the ass 4 times and I turn around to see someone from another team behind us. NO ONE WAS WATCHING THE REAR!! He killed myself and 3 other team mates before being absolutly ripped apart by the other 4 guys. <br/><br/>Anyway, thanks to him I was left with a memory of paintball that won&#8217;t fade any time soon. <br/><br/><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20020604020855/http://www.jeremyhubert.com/images/photos/welt.jpg"/> <br/><br/>Yeah, so.. that hurt. Top that off with the fact that they had just cleaned the water in my hot tub so it was FREEZING cold when I got home to relax, and it turned out to be a great day! I can&#8217;t wait to go again! It was a blast!</span><br/></span></p>
