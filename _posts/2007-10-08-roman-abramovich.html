title: Making millionaires in your sleep

<p>There was <a href="http://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/august04/0804legrandbleu.html">a little boat</a> sitting in English Bay the other day.  We stumbled upon it when we were out cruising around the bay.</p>



<p>After a quick little google search, we found out that it belongs to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Abramovich">Roman Abramovich</a>, the Russian Billionaire.</p>



<p>Out of sheer boredom, my roommate and I did the math and figured out what Roman makes per second, assuming his 13.3 billion dollar net worth makes him an average of 10% per annum.   </p>



<p><strong>42 Dollars USD per SECOND!</strong></p>



<p>Well, it may not be much.. but at least he&#8217;s off to a good start.</p>



<p>By the time he wakes up from a night&#8217;s rest, he could give away $1.23 million to a lucky passerby and he wouldn&#8217;t have any less than he did when he went to sleep. And that&#8217;s not counting compound interest.</p>



<p>In 24 hours, he could crown 4 new millionaires.  28 new millionaires per week. <strong>One thousand, four hundred and fifty six</strong> new millionaires per year without any impact on his net worth.</p>



<p>*sigh*</p>



<p>In the meantime.. I just like looking at <a href="http://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/august04/0804legrandbleu.html">his boat</a>.</p>
