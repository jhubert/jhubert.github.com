<p><span>A few days ago, as I was suffering from a high fever and a huge headache, I was lying in bed preparing (mentally) for my trip back home. I was still debating whether I was making the right decision by going back to Canada, or if I should accept the offer to stay for another 8 months.</span></p>

<p><span>As I was flipping through the paper, I came across the weather page and next to the forcasts, it had a big heading that read:</span></p>

<p><span><strong>You&#8217;d rather be in&#8230;Vancouver, Canada.</strong> </span></p>

<p><span>Above it, there was a picture of 3 people splashing in the waters of Spanish Banks. At that point, I decided that the paper was right. As beautiful and exciting as melbourne is, there is something incredible about Vancouver that just makes me love it. It is most definitly one of the greatest places to live in the world, and it was time to go home.</span></p>

<p><span>I love Vancouver. On that note, I don&#8217;t mean to downplay melbourne. Of all the cities I&#8217;ve travelled to, Melbourne is most definitly one of the nicest, and probably the only other city that I would consider living in at this point in time.</span></p>
