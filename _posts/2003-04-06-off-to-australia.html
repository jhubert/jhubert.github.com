<p><span>I&#8217;m sitting in Narita Tokyo Airport right now at one of the Yahoo! Free Internet Cafes. It&#8217;s a really sweet setup. <br/><br/>Anyway, yeah. I&#8217;m in Tokyo. In case you weren&#8217;t aware, I&#8217;m heading to Australia for two months. I left Vancouver this morning, and I have a 6 hour stopover in Tokyo before heading to Sydney. <br/><br/>This whole trip was kind of short notice. I found out on tuesday that I was going to be heading to Australia today. I mean, I didn&#8217;t HAVE to leave today, but I got a sweet deal on a ticket which makes it a great time to visit Australia. After the last month of work I put in, I need a vacation anyway.<br/><br/>I&#8217;ll be staying in Melbourne for the better part of my trip, and most likely partying with Robert and the boys from CVEG AU. It should be a good time. They sound like great people to party with.. and hell, it&#8217;s Australia. I just have to remember to stay away from the Canals and I&#8217;ll be fine. :s <br/><br/>If you wanna get ahold of me, drop me an e-mail by clicking the link on the menu bar. i will be checking my e-mail daily, and I&#8217;ll be sure to get back to you. <br/><br/>I don&#8217;t get to spend too much time in Tokyo this time, but on my return flight I spend a night in Tokyo city, so that should be interesting. <br/><br/>I&#8217;ll update you more as I go. Keep in touch.<br/><br/>Cheers, <br/>Jeremy </span></p>
