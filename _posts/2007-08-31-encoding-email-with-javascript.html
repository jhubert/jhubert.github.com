<a href="http://pastie.caboo.se/92921">Encoding your e-mail address with ruby and javascript</a><br/><p>This is a little ruby function I wrote for creating static HTML javascript mailto links. You can use this to protect almost any html content that you don&#8217;t want spiders or people without javascript support to see.</p>
