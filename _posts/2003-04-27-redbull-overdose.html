<p>Well, apparently Caffeine is bad for ya. Who would have thought. :P</p>

<p>I spent the weekend pucking my guts out and with a massive, pounding headache. I&#8217;m not positive, but I&#8217;m willing to bet Caffeine had a large part in me being that way&#8230; well, apart from my stupidity.</p>

<p>I went out on thursday night, after having a red bull, and had about 7 Jaggermeister &amp; Red Bulls (Half a can each), then went back to the office after the club, and had another red bull. A few hours later (morning) I had a &#8216;lift up&#8217; or something (basically a red bull), and then over the course of the day I had 3 more Red Bulls.. or Vs. So, in a 24 hour period, I drank about 10 cans of Red Bull. According to the label, the maximum daily intake is 2 cans. Apparently I failed to notice that. :|</p>

<p>So, anyway, at about midnight that night (still at work) I run to the kitchen and begin to vomit. I continue for, oh, 9 hours.. with breaks to pass out from dehydration and exhaustion.</p>

<p>Basically, to make a long story short, it was one of the worst nights I have had in a long time. To top it off, the caffeine withdrawl is supposed to last 4 - 6 days. So, I still have a headache, and it&#8217;s 4 days later. :|</p>

<p>I think I&#8217;m going to lay off the caffeine for a bit. I really miss the healthy kick i was on in Vancouver. :( It&#8217;s really not as easy here. I&#8217;m always too busy working, and I&#8217;m not setup like I am in Van. I eat out literally 7 days a week, and it&#8217;s hard to find good, nutritious food near my office. (No subway. :P ) I don&#8217;t have an oven, and I have a stove but nothing to cook with. I&#8217;m supposed to supply my own, but I&#8217;m only here for two months (Am I?), so why would I go out and buy all that crap that I already have in Van? Being healthy was fun. Really. I liked it a lot. :$</p>

<p>Speaking of which (not really), I need to install MSN icons into this journal. heck, everything should have MSN icons in it. I use them all the time, and it bugs me when they don&#8217;t work. Wow. I&#8217;m a geek.</p>
