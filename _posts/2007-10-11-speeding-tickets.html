<blockquote>A few years ago I was pulled over for speeding. The officer got out of his car and came up to my window and asked to see my pilot&#8217;s license (since I was flying). I happened to have a private pilots license so I pulled it out gave it to the officer. He let me go and told me to slow down.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2007/LIVING/wayoflife/10/10/aa.traffic.tix/">How they got out of traffic tickets - CNN.com</a>
