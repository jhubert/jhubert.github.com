title: Good Will Hunting and Gas Prices

And of course the oil companies used the skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices. A cute little ancillary benefit for them but it ain&#8217;t helping my buddy at two-fifty a gallon.</blockquote>&#8212;It&#8217;s amazing how accurate this quote is, coming from a movie made in 1997: <br/><a href="http://www.whysanity.net/monos/goodwill.html">Good Will Hunting</a>
