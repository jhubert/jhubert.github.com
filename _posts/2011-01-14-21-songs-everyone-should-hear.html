title: The 21 best new-ish songs that I don't think enough people have heard
category: article

<p>The other day, I was hanging out with some co-workers of mine and we started talking about music. It turns out the neither of them had heard many of the songs that I was really into lately. I promised to introduce one of them to my musical tastes, and went home to make a CD.</p>

<p>I then started playing the CD for a few other friends, and it turned out that NONE of them had heard most of the tracks on the CD. Had they not all really liked the CD, I would have just written myself as having odd taste in music. But since they did, I&#8217;m writing this post to make sure everyone else can be exposed to the more awesome music.</p>

<p>Another thing that I realized after looking over the album is that almost all of the songs were introduced to me by <a href="http://about.me/msh">Morgan Holzer</a>. That girl has wicked taste in music and I highly recommend you check out <a href="http://www.popten.net/author/morgan-holzer/">her PopTen stuff</a>.Â </p>
