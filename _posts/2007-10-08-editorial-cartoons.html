I was searching google images for &#8220;gift wrapping&#8221; of all things, and I stumbled upon a set of editorial cartoons.  They were done by a man named Clay Bennett.



These are a few of my favorites:



On Security:

On Medicine and Politics:

On the inability for the CIA and FBI to work together:

View the entire <a href="http://www.claybennett.com/archives.html">collection of editorial cartoons</a>, or just check out <a href="http://www.claybennett.com/">Clay Bennett&#8217;s website</a>



And my Number 1 favorite:
